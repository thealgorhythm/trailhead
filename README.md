## Salesforce Trailhead - *Extracted from [Trailhead FAQ](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Trailhead_FAQ)*
### What is Trailhead?
Trailhead is the fun way to learn Salesforce. Test your knowledge while earning points and badges to celebrate your achievements.

## Content
### What is a unit, module, or trail?
Content in Trailhead is organized into units, modules, and trails to help guide you through everything you need to know about Salesforce.

A unit takes you through several learning objectives for features, tools, or best practices related to Salesforce. Most units conclude with a challenge that reinforces the learning objectives.

A module is a series of units for a particular subject area. Once you’ve completed all the units in a module, you will earn a badge that will be displayed on your Trailhead profile.

A trail is a series of modules, organized in a guided learning path to help you master different aspects of Salesforce.

### Do you plan to add more content to Trailhead?
Much more content is in the works. Team Trailhead releases new content every month. Have ideas for new content? [Share them here](https://getfeedback.com/r/jizmPS48/).

## Challenges, Points, & Badges
### What is a challenge and how do they work?
A challenge is an interactive exercise that tests your knowledge of a related unit. Users accept challenges by attempting to complete them on a Developer Edition and allowing Trailhead to assess the outcome. Users will need to log into a Developer Edition via Trailhead to allow a challenge to be assessed. By completing a challenge, you earn points that get added to your Trailhead profile. [View video for a demo of how challenges work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr7MYgAaeJs).

### How do I earn points and badges?
Point are earned when you complete each unit. Badges are automatically earned when you finish all the units in a module and are displayed on your Trailhead profile.

### How can I share my progress with others?
